# Specification Quality Checklist: Urdu (ur-PK) Language Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed; the feature description from the conversation context was comprehensive and all decisions have reasonable defaults documented in the Assumptions section.
- The spec covers 6 user stories (2x P1, 3x P2, 1x P3) with 14 functional requirements and 8 measurable success criteria.
